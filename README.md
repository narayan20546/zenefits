# zenefits

Read employee information from zenefits api with the access token for the company and display the employee information. 

This is a basic employee directory. There are lot of things that can be added, but given the timeframe i have done just the basic part. 

Please copy all the files to your htdocs/webroot directory and then it can be acessed as https://localhost/zenefits

Tech stack used: HTML, CSS, php and Js with datatable

Things that could be done in later stages:

1. On clicking employee name open new page with his/her detailed information.
2. Add lazy loading as the api returns only 20 entries in one go.
3. Depending on the data size, we can even either opt for database .
4. Should add caching mechanism to not overload the calls to api.


This is just the basic UI as per the challenge provided.

I have used Wamp with php 7.2 to test and run the problem.

Out put will look like screenshot attached
